# PrimoNUIShow
Bookmarklet for showing RecordID as well as links for "Show PNX" and "Show Source Record"

## Functionality
Use the bookmarklet on the brief results list of the Primo new UI. It will add an
new line after each record with the information as described above.

## Special records

### FRBR
FRBR-records will be prepended with a short note that these are represented by
a preferred or generic record.

### PCI
PCI-records have a slightly different link for "Show PNX" and it is not possible to show
their Source record.

### SFX
SFX-records will only have a "Show PNX" link, since their source records are not
available as well.
