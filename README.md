# PrimoNUIShow
Bookmarklet for showing **RecordID** as well as links for **Show PNX**,
**Show Source Record** and **Show RIS**  in Primo's New User Interface (NUI).

SvG did a very thorough description of what this bookmarklet does and does not
do in a [Community Knowledge Article](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Primo/Community_Knowledge/How_to_%E2%80%93_Useful_bookmarklets_for_Primo_New_UI_troubleshooting).

## Functionality
Use the bookmarklet on the brief results list or full view of the Primo NUI.
It will add a new line after each record (respectively after the bibliographic
info) with the information listed above.

## Special records

### FRBR
FRBR-groups will be prepended with a short note that these are represented by
a preferred or generic record.

### Third Node Adaptors (PCI, EBSCO etc.)
Third Node Adaptor records can not have their source record or RIS shown.

## PrimoVE

Since show RIS only works in the old UI atm, this link is not available for
PrimoVE.
